# Setting:
# $CONF['encrypt'] = 'dovecot:SHA512-CRYPT';
# $CONF['dovecotpw'] = "/usr/bin/doveadm pw";
# in postfixadmin's config.local.php 
# caused problems to access /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf in SElinux environment (Centos 7).
#
# Solution copied from this comment: https://github.com/opensolutions/ViMbAdmin/issues/95#issuecomment-121966988
#
# Citation:
# In my case, this error was caused by SELinux preventing doveadm to access the files in /etc/dovecot.
#
# sudo -u nginx /usr/bin/doveadm pw -s 'SHA512-CRYPT' -u 'something@somewhere.com' -p 'password'
# (the command line that's passed by ViMbAdmin) worked fine, so it had to be something else.
#
# /var/log/audit/audit.log (I always check SELinux last ğŸ˜›) had entries suggesting that doveadm was called from httpd_t context, and not allowed to access the dovecot_etc_t context of the dovecot config files.
# This TE file solved it for me:
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
